John looks nervous. He is sitting on a bench preparing himself for the upcoming interview. John just graduated, and he needs a job right now. All of his friends have received offers, but he hasn't. He feel so frustrated, but he's not ready to give up. I mean, at least not today. John always remembered the advice his mother had given him: "Whatever you do in life, do it to the best of your ability". So, John motivated himself to go into the interview with the utmost confidence. He prepared his notes, talking points, and even dressed up as sharp as he could. John then stepped into the interview...

He was greeted by the stern look by the interviewer, and John felt the pressure come up to him. He adjusted the caller and went inside to take a seat at the desk. The interviewer asked "How old are you?" John answered that he was 22. The interviewer replied "Oh, a young 
one." The interviewer asked John some preliminary questions to know about John a little bit more. John was easing into the interview until the interviewer tested John on his aptitude in this job.
